20.1-6
Most graph algorithms that take an adjacency-matrix representation as
input require Ω(V2) time, but there are some exceptions. Show how to
determine whether a directed graph G contains a universal sink—a
vertex with in-degree |V| – 1 and out-degree 0—in O(V) time, given an
adjacency matrix for G.
