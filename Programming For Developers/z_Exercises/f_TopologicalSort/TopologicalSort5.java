20.4-5

Another way to topologically sort a directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) is
to repeatedly find a vertex of in-degree 0, output it, and remove it and
all of its outgoing edges from the graph.

Explain how to implement this idea so that it runs in time O(V + E).

What happens to this algorithm if G has cycles?
